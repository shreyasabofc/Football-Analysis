FIFA 22 Player Data Analysis & Dashboard
Project Overview

This project explores the FIFA 22 Complete Player Dataset and demonstrates how to clean, analyze, and visualize football player data using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, ipywidgets).
The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and an interactive dashboard for exploring player stats.

The main goal is to:
1. Understand player attributes (overall, potential, pace, shooting, etc.)
2. Compare players across clubs, leagues, and nationalities
3. Build visualizations to highlight insights
4. Provide an interactive way to explore football data

-->Dataset

Source: Kaggle – FIFA 22 Complete Player Dataset; 
 Format: .xlsx file (used only one file with all player attributes)
 Size: ~19,000 players × 110 features.

-->Key Steps

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing.

Handling missing values.

Encoding categorical variables.

Converting positions & preferred foot into numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),

Summary statistics of key attributes,

Distribution plots (overall, potential, wages, values),

Correlation heatmaps between attributes,

Feature Engineering,

Created binary encodings for categorical fields,

Extracted position indicators (RW, ST, CF, etc.),

Data Visualization,

Histograms & scatter plots of attributes,

Top 10 players by market value & overall rating,

Nationality & club distribution of players,

Interactive Dashboard (Plotly + ipywidgets),

Dropdown to filter by league and club.

Sliders for age and rating filters,

Dynamic scatter plots and bar charts.
